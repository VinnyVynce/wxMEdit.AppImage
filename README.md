# wxMEdit.AppImage
This is the repository to install the unofficial AppImage for [wxMEdit](https://github.com/wxMEdit/wxMEdit).

## Getting started

## Notes regarding this appimage
The software, wxMEdit, was built in Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial) in a virtulized environement. Please use a modern amd64 linux distribution before trying. I'm using Fedora 35 for reference.
